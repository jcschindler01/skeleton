# Skeleton

I am using this as a test for packaging distributions. You can find it [here](https://github.com/jcschindler01/skeleton).

Test distro [here](https://test.pypi.org/project/skeleton-JCSCHINDLER01/).


Recommended dev method:
Clone from github.
Local install using pip install -e .
When ready to release: git tag, python -m build, upload
Download and test release in venv.
